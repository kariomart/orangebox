        "description": "Post pandemic, traditionally-retail brands looked towards the digital landscape to innovate on their core offering. I partnered with Coach to create their first foray into this new world: a game almost anyone could play, in browser, on their phones. It launched in 30+ countries, alongside many physical retail activations. hundreds of thousands of people played it and collected millions of hearts over the course of its 2 month activation.",
        "insight": "gen-z is seeking out more authentic forms of advertisements that provide them value without trying to sell them something.",
        "solution": "develop a game on the most accessible platform & hardware possible (the mobile browser), and make it simple yet addicting. remove it from the commercial elements of the campaign, so it can focus on telling a new brand story.",
        "value": "hundreds of thousands of players worldwide. millions of hearts collected. helped Coach put their best foot forward in a new digital landscape."
