            <p>Post pandemic, traditionally-retail brands looked 
                towards the digital landscape to innovate on their core offering. I partnered with Coach to create their first foray into this new world: a game almost anyone could play, in browser, on their phones. It launched in 30+ countries, alongside many physical retail activations. hundreds of thousands of people played it and collected millions of hearts over the course of its 2 month activation.</p>
